# Capstone-Project

I want to create a remote-controlled submarine. The submarine will be equipped with sonar, a camera, an airsoft machine gun, speakers that the person controlling the sub can speak out of, and torpedoes. I hope to make this big, but not life-sized. I'll have to see how big I can get with the amount of filament I am allowed to use, while still having extra for prototypes and others parts. I want the remote to have a live feed of the on-board camera, as well as statistics from the sonar. I also want everything on the sub to be controlled by the remote.
